![Eight Quarters](https://raw.github.com/rharmes/eightquarters/gh-pages/images/readme-eightquarters.png)

This blog is meant as a project to better learn git, Jekyll, and responsive design, as well as a chronicle of the hard mistakes I've made while learning to work with wood in my tiny basement shop.

The fonts I use are [Thirsty Rough](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/yellow-design/thirsty-rough/) and [Proxima Nova Soft](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova-soft/), both purchased from [MyFonts](http://www.myfonts.com/) and served as webfonts. The design and the responsive layout take obvious inspiration from Trent Walton and [his amazing site](http://trentwalton.com/).
